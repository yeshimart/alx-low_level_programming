  README: 0x10. C - Variadic Functions üìù

Welcome to the repository for the "0x10. C - Variadic Functions" project! This project focuses on variadic functions in the C programming language. Variadic functions allow a function to receive a variable number of arguments.

üìÅ Project Structure:
The project contains the following files:

variadic_functions.h: This header file contains the function prototypes of all the variadic functions implemented in the project.

0-sum_them_all.c: This file contains a function named sum_them_all that calculates the sum of a variable number of integers passed as arguments.

1-print_numbers.c: This file contains a function named print_numbers that prints a variable number of integers passed as arguments.

2-print_strings.c: This file contains a function named print_strings that prints a variable number of strings passed as arguments.

3-print_all.c: This file contains a function named print_all that prints a variable number of elements of any data type passed as arguments.

100-hello_holberton.asm: This assembly file is an additional optional file that contains an assembly function that prints the string "Hello, Holberton" using inline assembly in C.
