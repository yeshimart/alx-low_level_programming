0x14. C - Bit Manipulation
This project is about learning the basics of bit manipulation in C.

General Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
All your files should be executable
You are not allowed to use any library functions other than _putchar
Tasks
0. Bitwise operators
Write a function that converts a binary number to an integer.
Prototype: int binary_to_integer(const char *binary)
The function should return the integer value of the binary number.
The function should ignore any whitespace in the binary string.
The function should return 0 if the binary string is invalid.
1. Bitwise AND
Write a function that performs a bitwise AND operation on two integers.
Prototype: int bitwise_and(int x, int y)
The function should return the result of the bitwise AND operation.
2. Bitwise OR
Write a function that performs a bitwise OR operation on two integers.
Prototype: int bitwise_or(int x, int y)
The function should return the result of the bitwise OR operation.
3. Bitwise XOR
Write a function that performs a bitwise XOR operation on two integers.
Prototype: int bitwise_xor(int x, int y)
The function should return the result of the bitwise XOR operation.
4. Bitwise NOT
Write a function that performs a bitwise NOT operation on an integer.
Prototype: int bitwise_not(int x)
The function should return the result of the bitwise NOT operation.
5. Right shift
Write a function that performs a right shift operation on an integer.
Prototype: int right_shift(int x, int n)
The function should return the result of the right shift operation.
The value of n can be any positive or negative integer.
6. Left shift
Write a function that performs a left shift operation on an integer.
Prototype: int left_shift(int x, int n)
The function should return the result of the left shift operation.
The value of n can be any positive or negative integer.
