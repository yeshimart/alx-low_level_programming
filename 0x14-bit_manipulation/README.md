# Title: 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

**Description**: This project is about bit manipulation in C. You will learn how to use bitwise operators to set, clear, and test individual bits in a variable. You will also learn how to use bitwise operators to perform common operations such as bit shifting, masking, and two's complement.

### Learning Objectives:

Explain to anyone, without the help of Google, how to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators.
Requirements:

- All code must be written in C and follow the Betty style guide.
- You are not allowed to use global variables or more than 5 functions per file.
- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free, and exit.
- All your header files should be include guarded.
