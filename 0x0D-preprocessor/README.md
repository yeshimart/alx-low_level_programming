0x0D. C - Preprocessor
Description
This repository contains my solutions to the projects and tasks of the 0x0D. C - Preprocessor program, which is part of the low-level programming and algorithms curriculum at Holberton School.

The goal of this project is to familiarize ourselves with the preprocessor in the C programming language. We will learn about the different directives, macros, predefined macros, and how to use them effectively in our code.

Project Requirements
All code is written in C.
All files should be compiled with gcc using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic.
All files should pass the Holberton Betty coding style.
Project Tasks
 0. Object-like Macro
 1. Pi
 2. File name
 3. Function-like Macro
 4. SUM
 5. Worst abuse of the C preprocessor (IOCCC winner, 1986)
 6. Fun with the preprocessor
