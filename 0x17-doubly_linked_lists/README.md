# Doubly Linked List Project

This document outlines the requirements and objectives for the doubly linked list project.

## What is a Doubly Linked List?

A doubly linked list is a data structure composed of nodes, each containing data and pointers to both the previous and next nodes in the list. This enables efficient traversal and manipulation in either direction.

## Learning Objectives:

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- **Explain**: Describe the concept of a doubly linked list without external resources.
- **Utilize**: Implement and employ doubly linked lists in your code.
- **Understand & Implement**: Grasp and implement various operations on doubly linked lists, including insertion, deletion, and searching.
- **Research**: Develop your independent research skills to find relevant information.

## Copyright & Plagiarism:

- **Strictly Prohibited**: Copying or pasting solutions from other sources is not allowed.
- **Consequences**: Plagiarism in any form will result in program removal.
- **Confidentiality**: All project-related content is confidential and cannot be published.

## Requirements:

### Coding Environment:
- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Platform**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- **Newlines**: All files must end with a new line character.

### Project Files:
- **Mandatory**: README.md file in the project root directory.
- **Coding Style**: All code files must adhere to the Betty coding style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- **Function Limit**: Maximum of 5 functions per file.
- **Data Structure**: Use the provided doubly linked list node structure in lists.h.
- **Header Files**: Include-guard all header files.

### Function Prototypes:
- Define prototypes for all functions in lists.h.

## Additional Information:

- **Example main.c Files**: These files demonstrate function testing but are not required for submission.
- **Evaluation**: We will use custom main.c files different from the examples.

## Getting Started:

1. Familiarise yourself with the provided doubly linked list node data structure.
2. Study the learning objectives and understand the expected level of knowledge.
3. Start implementing functions in separate files, adhering to the style guide and function limitations.
4. Test your code thoroughly and ensure it meets the requirements.
5. Push your code to your git repository.

## Remember:

- This project is an opportunity to develop your understanding and implementation skills for doubly linked lists.
- Focus on independent learning and avoid plagiarism.
- Don't hesitate to seek clarification or ask for help if needed.
