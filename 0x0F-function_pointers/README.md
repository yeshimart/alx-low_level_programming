# Project: 0x0F-function_pointers

## Description

The `0x0F-function_pointers` project is an educational project part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on the concept of function pointers in C programming.

The project includes various C programs that demonstrate the usage and implementation of function pointers. Each program showcases different functionalities and scenarios where function pointers are useful.

## Files

The project contains the following files:

- `0-print_name.c`: A C function that prints a name using a function pointer.
- `1-array_iterator.c`: A C function that iterates over an array and performs an action specified by a function pointer.
- `2-int_index.c`: A C function that searches for an integer in an array using a function pointer.
- `3-calc.h` and `3-op_functions.c`: A header file and implementation file for a simple calculator program using function pointers.
- `100-main_opcodes.c`: A C program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.
- `function_pointers.h`: A header file containing function prototypes used across the project.
